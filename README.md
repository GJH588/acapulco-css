Open Source Counter-Strike: Source internal cheat.

## I am still working on this!
The code has very few comments still due to my bad habits. I am very busy IRL so please be patient, I am still updating this cheat.

This is not supposed to be a fully featured internal cheat. There are very few implemented features. All I am providing here is a cheat where people add their own work.

This is what the menu looks like so far:
